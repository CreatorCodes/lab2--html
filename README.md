This project contains a basic structure using HTML5 semantic elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>.
A navigation bar with links for easy access.
A contact form that ensures proper user input through HTML5 validation.
Compliance with web standards as verified by the W3C Validator.
The index.html file was tested using the W3C HTML Validator (validator.w3.org), and initial errors/warnings were detected, including:
(misplaced <!DOCTYPE html> – The document did not start with a proper doctype declaration, causing parsing issues.

<head> element missing a <title> tag – Every HTML document must have a <title> inside <head>.
Stray doctype declaration – The <!DOCTYPE html> was incorrectly placed or duplicated.
Unexpected <html> tag – The <html> tag appeared in an invalid position, leading to parsing errors.
Missing heading in <section> – A section must have a heading to provide structure and context to the content inside it.
Fatal error – Due to these structural mistakes, the validator could not process further errors.)
These issues were corrected, and the final validation confirmed the HTML is error free and with no warnings .
All the project file using Git have been uploaded to GitHub for easy access and collaboration.
